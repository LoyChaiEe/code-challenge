# Switcheo Code Challenge Problem #2 #

The problem has been attempted with basic functionality inside with some basic css styling.

The problem is attempted as a Full-Stack question, with React.js as frontend and express.js as backend

The data is stored in data.js in the backend folder

For the token images to be displayed properly, the images should be inside the src folder as tokens folder as token images is added as gitignore

To run the frontend, run npm i to install the required packages first then run npm start

To run backend, run npm i to install the required packages first then run npm start

Both backend and frontend must be run for it to work as most computational logic is in the backend
